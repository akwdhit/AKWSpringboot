AKW Spring Boot Play Area

Welcome to AKW Spring Boot. My name is Adhityo Kresno W. Please feel free to view or copy my code in this area. A link to my github or reference to my name would be appreciated.

In order to run these apps, you need to:
1. Build via gradle (One option): ./gradlew build for linux or gradlew.bat build for windows.
2. Run the java built by the first step
or
you might use akwRun.bat, I prepare it for us. :)
